Blockchain based De-Fi and Benefit Transfers in Agriculture

Aiming to raise Income and reduce latency in benefits for Low Income Farmers under Blockchain Architecture,our Idea is to decentralize existing storage,lessen middlemen and automate the supply chain processes through smart contracts and real-time tracking to enhance efficiency, minimizes delays, and ensures prompt payments, thereby improving the overall income and livelihoods of low-income farmers.

In my idea, I aim to connect the lower income farmers on a priority basis with the customers by creating a common ground between the two stakeholders in the supply chain of the commodities like potato , onions , tomato etc using blockchain technology and uses a smart contract to deliver the payment straight into the farmers account.
