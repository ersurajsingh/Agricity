Blockchain based De-Fi and Benefit Transfers in Agriculture

Aiming to raise Income and reduce latency in benefits for Low Income Farmers under Blockchain Architecture,our Idea is to decentralize existing storage,lessen middlemen and automate the supply chain processes through smart contracts and real-time tracking to enhance efficiency, minimizes delays, and ensures prompt payments, thereby improving the overall income and livelihoods of low-income farmers.For the idea , in the first phase we would onboard the farmers and collect their data Taking into account their annual produce , type of crops, purchase cost, area of land, debts. Similarly in the next phase we would on boarding the Customers from the nearby city where the household needs to be surveyed as what type of rice, vegetable, fruits are mostly preferred, average price and the storage capacity Finally we would do the Data Analysis and create a personalized virtual corridor connecting right farmers to the right consumer where the Farmer knows the demands and price straight away from the end customer.In order to plug loopholes in the DBT system, we propose a blockchain-based system. Blockchain consists of cryptographic hash secured distributed ledgers which maintain an immutable log of transactions between all participants of a blockchain network. They have the ability to execute Smart Contracts, which allow for automation of execution of real-world contracts given that certain specified conditions are met. Appropriating the Governments Aadhaar UID, we aim to develop a smart blockchain which automates the disbursement of subsidy which bypasses the need for banks in rural nodes while creating an auditable and transparent ecosystem to curb corruption and financial mismanagement.<br>

In my idea, I aim to connect the lower income farmers on a priority basis with the customers by creating a common ground between the two stakeholders in the supply chain of the commodities like potato , onions , tomato etc using blockchain technology and uses a smart contract to deliver the payment straight into the farmers account.
